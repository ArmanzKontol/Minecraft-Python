# Terrain

* Enable blending mode to get semi-transparent textures working. Render in the right order so they show up correctly.
* Show cracks (and particles) as block_damage increases

# Items

* return extra amount to inventory if quick access is full?

# Inventory

* create inventory management screen implementing:
- item stacks
- Jimx's crafting system

# Misc
- need place for brainstorming/ideas etc. related to project, so we can cooperate (IRC/forums/Reddit/mailing list?)
