# Terrain

* Enable blending mode to get semi-transparent textures working. Render in the right order so they show up correctly.
* Show cracks (and particles) as block_damage increases
* Implement sinking in blocks, based on their density
* Add option to change world (for example from save) during program execution without closing Window
* improve block rendering - shouldn't show bits of other textures around edges
* make water spread to surrounding empty areas

# Items

# Inventory
